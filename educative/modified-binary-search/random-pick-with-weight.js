/*
Statement:
Youâ€™re given an array of positive integers, weights, where weights[i] is the weight of the i th index.
Write a function, Pick Index(), which performs weighted random selection to return an index from the weights array.
The larger the value of weights[i], the heavier the weight is, and the higher the chances of its index being picked.
Suppose that the array consists of the weights [12,84,35].
In this case, the probabilities of picking the indexes will be as follows:
Index 0: 12 / ( 12 + 84 + 35 ) = 9.2
Index 1: 84 / ( 12 + 84 + 35 ) = 64.1
Index 2: 35 / ( 12 + 84 + 35 ) = 26.7
