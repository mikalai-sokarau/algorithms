/*
Statement:
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the treeâ€™s diameter.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


Test:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
   /   /
  8   9
 /   /
10  11
Output: 6 (10 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 9 -> 11)

  5
 / \
6   7
   / \
  8   9
Output: 3 (6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8/9)


Solution:
Post order DFS


Complexity:
T: O(n)
S: O(n)
